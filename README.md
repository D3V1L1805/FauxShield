# Deepfake Detection: A Multimodal Approach
Overview
This project focuses on detecting deepfakes using a comprehensive approach that combines video, audio, and image data. While many existing solutions focus on a single method, our model integrates all three to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. The performance metrics achieved are impressive, with video detection performing well, image detection achieving 90.85% accuracy, and audio detection reaching 99.05% accuracy.

Features
Multimodal Detection: Integrates video, audio, and image data for deepfake detection.
High Accuracy:
Video detection: High performance
Image detection: 90.85% accuracy
Audio detection: 99.05% accuracy
Comprehensive Analysis: Utilizes multiple data types to improve the reliability of deepfake detection.
